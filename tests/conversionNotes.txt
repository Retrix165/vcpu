I'm using the `riscv_assembler` pip package in a virtual environment but the way it outputs files is annoying, so I want to change the code:

The new functionality would be:
    -Executable file format
    -Runs on specified file in `riscvfiles` (*.s)
    -Ouputs specified filename in `assembled` (.o)
