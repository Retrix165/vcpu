Registers:
    -33 total(?) 0x0-31 + pc
    -x0 is always 0
    -pc holds current instruction address
    -Store boolean, unsigned or two's complement integers


Instructions:
    -rs1,rs2, and rd are in the same bit position in all instructions
        -does make immediates more annoying apparently?
        -rs1 i[19:15]
        -rs2 i[24:20]
        -rd  i[11:7]
    -opcode is always i[6:0]
        -presumably sets some control bits and instruction path for how the data is handled, so not exactly just an identifier but affects instruction path, func
    -func3 is in [14:12] for most types
        -used to designate what specific instruction within the format we want to use, presumably affects some control bits/exection of the alu or mux gates 
    -immediates are sign extended
        -immediates for relevant instruction types are specifically reconstructed (pg 17 riscv spec)
        -uses i[31]
    
Will have to program in exception behavior eventually
    -integer computations won't cause exceptions
        -except maybe overflow if I want that?
    -Ex:
        exception on taken braken to a non aligned instruction
