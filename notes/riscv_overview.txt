Just basic and general RISCV Notes:

RISC = Reduced Instruction Set Computer
    -Fewer instructions supported, faster average instruction time compared to CISC (complex ...)
    -Different versions, obv
    
Definitions:
    -Core: an indpendent instruction fetching unit
    -Harts: hardware thread, for multithreading, seperate instruction handling
    -Co-processor: a different core unit that uses RISCV or maybe extra instructions, some autonomy to primary core
    -accelerator: non-programmable fixed function unit or core, think crypto mining machines or FPU,
    -EEI: execution enviornment interface
    -ISA: Instruction Set Architecture, usually is a base
    -XLEN: width of integer register
    -IALIGN: Instruction Alignment number in bits,
    -ILEN: Mamximum intrusction length supported
    -UNSPECIFIED: intentionally unconstrainted behavior

RISC-V ISA:
    -Base
        -need to have a standard base set for compilers/others to target translations to
        -some base versions separated by integer register bit width RV32I, RV64I
            -some variations in machine code versions of certain commands like add between versions
    -Extensions:
        -denoted by letters in the ISA title, not really gonna use these unless I have a lot of extra time
        -3 categories of extensions:
            -Standard: defined by RISCV Foundation, machinecode of commands will not conflict with eachother
            -Reserved: not currently defined machine encodings but reserved for future use
            -Custom/Non-standard: wild west, may or may not conform to Standard ISA or Base depending on type

RISC Memory:
    -each integer register is 2^XLEN (32, 64, 128 depending on version)
    -word = 32 bits, halfword = 16 bits, doubleword = 64 bits
    -probably gonna go with little-endian encoding
    -Memory is circular, so 2^XLEN-1 + 1 will go to location 0 in memory addresses, hardware needs to account for modulo
    -Memory Access:
        -Implicit:
            -Also read as instruction fetch stage
            -usually performed arbitrarily
                -However, if in a program you cache the memory state of certain registers at the beginning before the pc at is those instructions, memory may have changed and you need to ensure fencing/cache-control
        -Explicit:
            -done by specific load and store instructions at determined memory location
    -Memory Consistency Model(?):
        -dealing with different harts of a EEI
        -default is RISCV Weak Memory Ordering Model
            
Formats:
    -all have an opcode in i[6:0]
    R type
    
    I type
    S type
    B type
    U type
    J type
